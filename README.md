**LittleGPTracker** (a.k.a _'The piggy'_) is a music tracker optimised to run on portable game consoles. It is currently running on Game Park's GP2x & Caanoo, PSP, Dingoo, Windows, MacOS (intel/arm) & Linux (Debian).

It implements the user interface of [littlesounddj](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php), a very famous tracker for the _Gameboy_ platform that has been tried and tested by many users over the years, leading to a little complex but yet extremely efficent way of working.

All versions are available for free under the [GPLv3 License](LICENSE); however, if you like the project and want to contribute, don't hesitate to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/e4N2VM7sz6).
